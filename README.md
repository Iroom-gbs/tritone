# TRITONE
**Minecraft Client side in-game prioxity voice chatting via discord**

**This mod is currently under development and not yet available!!**

  ## Why not use this?
   * There are many other Minecraft prioxity voice chat modes.
   * Due to the limitations of Discord, 3D sound is not supported.
  ## Why use this?
   * Triton **does not** require any configuration on the server side. so, you can use Tritone on any public server in Minecraft.
   * Discord's voice chat has better sound quality than other modes.
  ## For development...
   * We used Rust JNI for on-JVM use of discord-game-sdk.
   * Before building this project, you need some setup...
